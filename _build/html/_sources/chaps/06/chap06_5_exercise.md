# Chapter 6 Exercises

:::{exercise}
Show that the method 

$$
\begin{aligned}
            y_{j+1} ~=~ y_j + hf_{j+1}        
    \end{aligned}
$$

 is absolutely stable for all
    $h\lambda \not\in (0,2)$.
:::

:::{exercise}
It can be shown that the method 

$$
\begin{aligned}
            y_{j+2} ~=~ y_j + \frac{h}{2}(f_{j+1} + 3f_j)        
    \end{aligned}
$$

 has an interval of absolute stability of
    $\left(-\frac{4}{3},0\right)$. Show that its region of stability is
    the circle on this interval as diameter.
:::

:::{exercise}
Find the interval of absolute stability of the $3^\text{rd}$ and
    $4^\text{th}$ order Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton methods using
    method.
:::

:::{exercise}
Show that the method 

$$
\begin{aligned}
            y_{j+2} ~=~ y_{j+1} + \frac{h}{2}(f_{j+2} + f_{j+1})        
    \end{aligned}
$$

 has an interval of absolute stability of
    $(-\infty,0)$. Explain how you can verify your results.
:::

:::{exercise}
Show that the Simpson's rule: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
            y_{j+2} ~=~ y_j + \frac{h}{3}(f_{j+2} + 4f_{j+1} + f_j)        
    \end{aligned}
$$

 has no interval of absolute stability. Try to verify
    your results by plotting the region of absolute stability.

**Answers to Tutorial Exercises**

Answers are given in each question. For question 3, you can check your
answers with the table of the interval of absolute stability and the
plots of the region of absolute stability for various methods show in
Chapter 5.

**Make sure you label both the $Re$ and $Im$ axes, shade and show
clearly the region of absolute stability in your plots.**
