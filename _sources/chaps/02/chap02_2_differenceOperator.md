# Finite Difference Operators

## Discrete Data Points

For a function defined on a continuous domain

$$f=f(x), ~~ x\in \mathbb{R},$$
	
we can use a **general** sequence to represent it at discrete locations

$$\left\{f_j\right\}_{j=-\infty}^{+\infty},$$
	
where  $f_j = f(x_j)$.

Usually, though not necessarily, we let $\left\{x_j\right\}_{j=-\infty}^{+\infty}$ be equally spaced, so

$$x_j= jh$$

where $h=x_{j+1}-x_j$ is called the step size (or step length), $h\in(0,+\infty)$.
