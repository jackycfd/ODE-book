# Basics of Differential Equations

```{prf:definition} Differential Equations
An equation containing the derivatives of one or more unknown functions (or
dependent variables), with respect to one or more independent variables, is said to be a **differential equation** (DE).
```
- Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)

    If a differential equation contains only ordinary derivatives of one or more unknown functions with respect to a single independent variable, it is said to be an ordinary differential equation (ODE).

- Partial Differential Equation (PDE)

    An equation involving partial derivatives of one or more unknown functions of two or more independent variables is called a partial differential equation (PDE).
