# Differential Equations

This chapter gives an introduction to differential equations (DEs), touching on:

- **[Basic concepts in differential equations](chap:pre:1)**
- **[Basic concepts in ordinary differential equations](chap:pre:2)**
- **[Analytical methods for solving ordinary differential equations](chap:pre:3)**

Although we won't cover the above topics in our lectures, we will refer them when necessary. Students should read through this chapter to ensure they have the prerequisite knowledge for learning computational methods in ordinary differential equations.
