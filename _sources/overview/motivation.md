# Overview

<!-- :Unit Title: Computational Methods in Ordinary Differential Equations -->
<!-- :Unit Code : 6G6Z3017 -->

## What will we learn?

Our main focus is to learn and apply a range of numerical methods to solve a single or a system of **First-Order** Ordinary Differential Equation(s) given as

- A single equation: $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dt}=f(t, y)$

- A system of equations: $\displaystyle \frac{d\mathbf{Y}}{dt}=\mathbf{F}(t, \mathbf{Y})$

We will also touch on graph theory and sparse matrix computation to:

- Form adjacency matrix for a graph,

- Reorder a graph to reduce the bandwidth and fill-ins of its adjacency matrix.

## Why are we learning about Ordinary Differential Equations?

Ordinary differential equations have wide applications in science and engineering:

- Physics
    - Fluid Dynamics

## Why are we learning Computational Methods?

In general there are two ways to solve ordinary differential equations:

- analytical methods

- computational methods

Analytical methods only work for a very limited number of simple cases, for most of the realistic complex problems we need to solve them numerically.
