# Motivation

## What we will learn?

Our main focus is to learn and apply numerical methods to solve  a single or a system of **First-Order** Ordinary Differential Equation(s)

- A single equation: $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dt}=f(t, y)$

- A system of equations: $\displaystyle \frac{d\mathbf{Y}}{dt}=\mathbf{F}(t, \mathbf{Y})$

### Why we learn about Ordinary Differential Equations?


### Why we learn Numerical Methods?
