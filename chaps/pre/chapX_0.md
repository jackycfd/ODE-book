# Basics of Differential Equations

This part gives an introduction to differential equations (DE), touching on the following topics:

- **[Basic concepts in differential equations](chap:pre:1)**
- **[Basic concepts in ordinary differential equations](chap:pre:2)**
- **[Analytical methods for solving ordinary differential equations](chap:pre:3)**

Although we won't cover the above topics in our lecture and tutorial sessions, we will refer them in our teaching when necessary. Students should read through this part at their own time to ensure they have the prerequisite knowledge for learning computational methods in ordinary differential equations.
